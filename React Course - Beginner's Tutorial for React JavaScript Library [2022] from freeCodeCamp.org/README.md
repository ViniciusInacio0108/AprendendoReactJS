# Notes

1. This is a project based on a course on YT with the same name as the Repo.
2. The whole project is in english and the next ones will be too.
3. The Mini Projects included in this Repo will not be dinamic Apps, been so they will not adjust dinamicly to the App screen size. This is due to the course, because in it i'm focusing in the ReactJS and JS part of the App not the styling and accessibility.

## All of the directories here can be downloaded and the code reviewed by anyone who wants too
