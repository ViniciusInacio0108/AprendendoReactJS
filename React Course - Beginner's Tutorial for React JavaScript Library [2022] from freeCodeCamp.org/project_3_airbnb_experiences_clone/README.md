# About this Mini Project

## What is it?

App is a clone from AirBNB Experiences tab.

This is app is created using create-react-app dependecies. Now we have a more advanced app where we use more advanced tools from React. Some of this tools includes: use of props for the components, consuming an data.js like file, using .map() to get data from our data.js, reusing components based on the data provided and more.

## Whats it does?

Just show you a page where you can see dinamic list of cards. In this cards you find many diferent sports and experiences that you can have with AirBNB.

## What is missing or peculiar to this App?

1. This app is not dinamicly adjusted to the screen size of the browser. Just focusing on the ReacJS part of it.
2. How we have not a DB to use, the cardData,js file is used as a receiving file from a DB.
