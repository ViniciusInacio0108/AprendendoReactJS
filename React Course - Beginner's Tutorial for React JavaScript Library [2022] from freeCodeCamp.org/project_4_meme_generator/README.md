# About this Mini Project

## What is it?

This is a project based on a course for ReactJS on YT. Here we have a more advanced project envolving new tools from React compared to the previous projects. In Project 4: Meme generator i have learned and practiced some of the best features in ReactJS: Hooks (useState and useEffect), componentization, dynamic Apps, fluid layouts, API requests, data manipulation and more.

## Whats it does?

This project is basically a meme generator test, where you can go and type 2 text one at the top and one at the bottom of a meme image and form a new meme. From the back all it does is use useEffect and Fetch to get data from an API only once at the load of the page and setAllMeme with useState containing and array with 100 memes. We also have a State to controll the meme url image src that will be shown to the client. We also get lots os functions, such as one to get a random number witch is gonna controll what index inside of our AllMeme array is selected controlling what Meme will be shown to the client. And easier functions to controle que State of the top and bottom texts where the client can input whatever it wants to nad the function will render it with setState.

## What is missing or peculiar to this App?

1. The visuals are not as much important as it needs to be, so will have some visual bugs. But the focus here is to use ReactJS tools.
